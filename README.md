ᯓ★ BACKGROUND

Sustainable Development Goals 3: Good Health and Well-Being
"IMPROVE EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS FOR GLOBAL HEALTH RISKS"

According to the World Health Organization, they found that around one third of the world's adult population is physically inactive, which is around 1.8 billion adults. It's worse for teens (age 11-17) where 81% of teens are physically inactive. 

Basic Programming Final Project which implements "The System" from the manhwa Solo Leveling in order to track an individual's daily performance in workouts/exercise.

ᯓ★ PROGRAM FLOW

❤︎ First the user will insert some information about themselves, such as Name, Somatotype, and Health Restrictions (might add a quiz idk).

❤︎ After that they'll enter the Main Game Menu where they can access information including their name, level, stats, daily quest, and other choices such as whether they want to try a certain quest which depends on their data and somatotype or if they want to exit the program.

❤︎ The User can choose which quest to do whether they want to do a daily quest or something else, when finishing the quest the user able to upgrade their stats or level depending on the amount of reps they've inserted (yes since it's c we are limited to individual/manually).

❤︎ If the user levels up the quest will get increasingly more difficult and they'll even gain new titles or ranks as per the solo leveling manhwa!
