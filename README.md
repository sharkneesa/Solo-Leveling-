ᯓ★ BACKGROUND

Sustainable Development Goals 3: Good Health and Well-Being
"IMPROVE EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS FOR GLOBAL HEALTH RISKS"

According to the World Health Organization, they found that around one third of the world's adult population is physically inactive, which is around 1.8 billion adults. It's worse for teens (age 11-17) where 81% of teens are physically inactive. 

Basic Programming Final Project which implements "The System" from the manhwa Solo Leveling in order to track an individual's daily performance in workouts/exercise.

ᯓ★ PROGRAM FLOW

❤︎ First the user will insert some information about themselves, such as Name, Height, Weight, Age, in which the program will use to calculate the user's BMI and check whether or not they're in a suitable age range to do the program.

❤︎ After that they'll enter the Main Game Menu where they can choose an action to do (1-6), with the following result of each case:

୨ৎ The first case to Access information including their name, level, stats, daily quest, and BMI.

୨ৎ The second case is to show daily quests so they can level up with each daily quest increasing in difficulty and reps each time the user levels up. You can only do 3 daily quests per day which is randomized and must wait for the next day before trying out new daily quests.

୨ৎ The third case is to do additional quests which is a bit more challenging and you can do each day which is randomized.

୨ৎ The fourth case is to upgrade your weight and if your BMI changes the system will update your BMI too.

୨ৎ The fifth case is to update the day so you can do new daily quests and quests and the system will generate new quests.

୨ৎ The sixth case is to exit the program/the system.

❤︎ The User can choose which quest to do whether they want to do a daily quest or something else, when finishing the quest the user able to upgrade their stats or level depending on the amount of reps they've inserted (yes since it's c we are limited to individual/manually).

❤︎ If the user levels up the quest will get increasingly more difficult and they'll even gain new titles or ranks as per the solo leveling manhwa!
